# Hi there, I'm Akshat! 👋

🚀 DevOps-focused Engineer | Fedora & Linux Enthusiast | Python & Automation

## About Me

I build reproducible labs, automation tooling and CI/CD workflows with a focus on Fedora and Linux systems. I enjoy solving infrastructure problems with code — combining scripting, configuration management, containers, and GitOps practices to make deployments reliable and repeatable.

- 👨‍💻 Currently working on: [fedora-devops-lab](https://github.com/akshat1903kk/fedora-devops-lab) — a hands-on lab for learning Fedora-based DevOps tooling and automation.
- 🌱 Learning & exploring: Containers (Podman/Docker), Ansible, Terraform, GitHub Actions, system hardening, and observability.
- 🔭 Interested in: DevOps tooling, developer experience on Linux, and open source collaboration.
- 🤝 Open to collaboration on Linux/DevOps projects and automation-focused work.
