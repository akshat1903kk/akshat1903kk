# Hi there, I'm Akshat 👋

I'm a self-driven developer and DevOps enthusiast from Varanasi, India.

I'm currently preparing for my engineering entrance exams while simultaneously building practical, hands-on skills in full-stack development and cloud-native technologies. I believe in learning by doing and documenting the entire process.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Focused On

I'm deep-diving into the world of DevOps by building a complete project from the ground up:

* **[Fedora DevOps Lab](https://github.com/akshat1903kk/fedora-devops-lab):** This is my personal, self-hosted lab. My goal is to build, containerize, and deploy a full-stack application (FastAPI backend + React frontend) on a Fedora server, complete with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring. I'm documenting every step of my #BuildInPublic journey.

## 💻 My Core Tech Stack

Here are the technologies I'm working with most actively:

* **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy
* **DevOps:** Docker, Git, Linux (Fedora)
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL (using Alembic for migrations)

## 🎨 Beyond the Code

When I'm not studying physics or containerizing an application, I find balance through my creative hobbies:
* Playing the guitar 🎸
* Creating art 🖌️
* Reading fiction 📚
