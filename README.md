### 🌱 About Me  

I’m a self-driven developer and DevOps enthusiast, currently preparing for my engineering entrance exams while building hands-on, real-world projects.  

My current mission is to explore the full DevOps pipeline — from backend APIs to container orchestration — and learn through practical implementation rather than theory dumps.  

I believe in *“learning by building, failing fast, and documenting everything.”*

### 🧩 What I’m Currently Working On  

**[Fedora DevOps Lab](https://github.com/akshat1903kk/fedora-devops-lab)**  
> A self-hosted full-stack lab project where I’m building, containerizing, and deploying a FastAPI backend with a React (Vite) frontend on a Fedora environment.  
> The goal: Implement CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and complete local automation from scratch.  

🧠 **Focus Areas:**  
- Building reproducible full-stack environments using Docker and Compose  
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions (coming soon)  
- Optimizing lightweight workflows for development on limited hardware

### 💻 Tech Stack  

**Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript  
**Backend:** Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy  
**DevOps:** Docker, Git, Linux (Fedora)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL (with Alembic for migrations)

### 🎨 Beyond the Code  

When I’m not debugging YAML files or fighting dependency errors, I unwind through:  
🎸 Playing the guitar  
🎨 Creating art  
📚 Reading fiction (and the occasional manga arc binge)
